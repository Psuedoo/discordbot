# Psuedoobot -- Discord

### Purpose of Development
Psuedoobot was created as a way to create a better connection between a streamers' Discord server and Twitch channel. The main functionality that inspired the development of Psuedoobot was the idea of playing audio commands triggered in
a Twitch channel. Many ways to solve the problem required the Twitch bot to be running on the same machine that was
being used to stream. To avoid any other complicated solutions, Psuedoobot was created.
